# Template C++ project

## Introduction

*Coming*

## File structure

* **bin**: Executables end up here.
* **build**: .o files needed for building end up here.
* **include**: Put your header files (.h, .hpp) here.
* **src**: Put your source code (.cpp) here.

## Dependencies

* g++ is used as the compiler. If you prefer something else this could easily be achieved by changing the CC variable in the makefile.
